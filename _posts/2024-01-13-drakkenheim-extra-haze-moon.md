The Haze Moon happens every 28th day of the month. Scholars believe this to be tied to the regular tides and moon phase cycles, somehow exciting and influencing the deposits of Delerium in the waters and soil of Drakkenheim. Whatever the cause, during this night the Haze grows even deeper and creepy octarine lights can be seen dancing in the sky; the walls between our world and the Space Between Worlds grow thin during this time.

Adventuring in Drakkenheim during a Haze Moon is foolhardy, but also immensely profitable.

## Rich Delerium veins 
New Delerium veins appear throughout the city. This bountiful Delerium can be found during the Haze Moon and for the next 2 (1d4) after it. When this time has passed, all the easily collectible Delerium has been harvested.
+ Whenever the characters search for Delerium, they find a “size” above what they would normally find - so a Fragment becomes a Shard and so on - up to the size of a Crystal. 
+ Whatever Delerium “size” is normally present at a location (as described in the relevant adventure chapter), is also increased the same way.

## Delerium Pearls
During a Haze Moon, Delerium present in the body of contaminated creatures crystallizes into small chunks of the element inside their gullets. These “pearls” (so called because of their smooth surface and rounded edges) vary in size, but are generally equivalent to Delerium Chips, Fragments or even Shards - based on the type of creature. Generally speaking, larger (and/or higher CR) creatures have larger Delerium Pearls inside of them. These pearls dissolve into the contaminated creatures’ bodies within 2 (1d4) hours after a Haze Moon is over, but remain in their form if extracted before then.

## Haze Fauna 
Weird and rare vegetation sprouts in areas where they would normally not survive. These plants grow unnaturally fast and wilt in a matter of hours after the Haze Moon has passed.
+ Eldritch Lilies can be rarely found in contaminated water areas outside of the Deep Haze - for example, floating in the Drann River or in decorative ponds or even fountains.
+ In the same areas, the water is particularly contaminated for the duration of the Haze Moon. Animated delerium sludges form in these waters and hypnotic eldritch blossoms sprout and wilt with the same accelerated rate.

## Moon-Touched Dregs 
Dregs are drawn to the Moon and roving packs of them (**dreg groups** and even **dreg hordes**) can be found swarming the city streets during a Haze Moon. The nature of their otherworldly corruption becomes more evident during such an event, their features even more warped and octarine light glowing in their eyes. 
+ Regulard **Dregs**’ attacks inflict an additional 7 (2d6) necrotic damage during a Blood Moon. **Groups** inflict an extra 11 (3d6) and **Hordes** an extra 17 (5d6) necrotic damage.
+ Whenever a non corrupted creature is struck by a Delerium Dreg during the Haze Moon, they are briefly touched by an unearthly intelligence from the Space Between Worlds. The creature has to succeed on a **DC 13 Wisdom**, **Intelligence** or **Charisma** saving throw. If they succeed, they are able to sever the connection in time; if they fail, the creature is affected by a form of short term _Drakkenheim Madness_ that lasts for 2 (1d4) days after the end of the Haze Moon.

## Mutating Flesh
**Haze hulks**, **protean abominations** and **grotesque gargants** tend to display even more monstrous features during a Haze Moon. Their flesh is in constant turmoil, their skin looks like the surface of a stormy sea.
+ Each of these creatures' attacks inflicts additional 11 (3d6) necrotic damage during a Haze Moon.
+ Whenever a non corrupted creature is struck by one of these creatures, their fetid ichors cause the wound to boil and the flesh around it to reshape itself. The creature has to succeed on a **DC 15 Constitution** saving throw. On a success, they are able to fight off the mutagenic surge; on a failure, they suffer a Mutation that lasts for 2 (1d4) days after the end of the Haze Moon.

## The Evil Dead 
**Haze wights** and **warp witches** act as a conduit for eldritch energies during a Haze Moon, their features transfixed by octarine streaks.
+ Each of these creatures' attacks inflicts additional 7 (2d6) radiant damage during a Haze Moon.
+ Whenever a non corrupted creature is struck by one of these creatures, the creature must succeed on a **DC 13 Dexterity** saving throw. On a success, they are able to move away in time not to close the loop; on a failure, the buildup of eldritch energies is released as an _Arcane Anomaly_.

## Mere Mortals
Not all the denizens of Drakkenheim are empowered by a Haze Moon.
+ Most **ratlings** and **garmyrs** try to avoid the streets during such night. Consider rerolling any random encounter that includes these creatures during a Haze Moon. At least a warlock of the rat god should be present if a ratling group is encountered though.
+ The **Hooded Lanterns** recognize the dangers these nights represent on their men. If you roll a random encounter with members of this faction, consider replacing them with one of the other faction teams instead. Otherwise, consider having the PCs run into a patrol of Lanterns looking for a missing member of their team.
+ Particularly zealous members of the **Silver Order** believe that it is their duty to fight back against such a clear display of evil. If the characters encounter them in a random encounter, consider them to be in a fight with a pack of dangerous enhanced monsters.
+ The **Queen’s Men** know there is profit to be had from all the Delerium crystalizing during a Haze Moon. They know that anyone out during such an event is probably there for the same reason, so consider a random encounter with members of such faction to be of the hostile kind - they want to shake down the PCs for any extra Delerium they may be carrying.
+ The more adventurous members of the **Amethyst Academy** are aware that no time is better suited to discover insights on the true nature of Delerium than during a Haze Moon. Consider having the PCs run into an academic delegation that would be more than happy to pay for some armed escort; consider also having the PCs discover some important arcane secrets (existence of spells, components, location of Delerium veins, etc) if they follow them around.
+ The Haze Moon is a sacred night for the **Followers of the Falling Fire** - it is said that the sacrament administered during such an event is particularly holy. Not only are pilgrimages increased during a Haze Moon, if the leaders of this faction believe the PCs to be important for the prophecy they may insist they take their pilgrimage during such a sacred time.
+ Any of the previous faction events may be retooled as a **quest** assigned to the PCs by a faction lieutenant if they are in good rapports with them.

## Variant: Unpredictable Haze Moon
If you want to add a pinch of suspense, consider having the Haze Moon be tied to the growing and shrinking pattern of the Delerium Heart. In this case, while the Haze Moon has so far _normally_ happened every 28th day of the month, new, unscheduled Haze Moons start to happen. 
+ Roll 1d100 every night that passes - on a 100 a Haze Moon happens. 
+ Afterwards, the event happens on 99-100, then on a 98-100 and so on.
+ The PCs or some of the factions may realise that the frequency of the Haze Moons is increasing and figure out there is some kind of “clock” until something happens. This is especially true once the frequency increases a few times.
