The main way for the PCs to gain access to the Inscrutable Tower is to either be allied with the Amethyst Academy or to force/convince someone with a sigil ring to open the gates for them. This feature is a way around that limitation, while also providing inspiration for an extra adventure.
	Beltrand Ebonsinger was a tenured Academy enchanter, living and conducting their business at the Inscrutable Tower before the fall of Drakkenheim; they specialized in infusing mechanical items with magical energies.
Unfortunately for them, they had an accident while working in the Golem Workshop; this accident costed them an arm.Fortunately for them, they were able to create a marvelous magi-mechanical arm to fully replace their lost limb. They got their moniker for obvious reasons after that.

## A fate worse than death
Beltrand has perished during the fall of the city. He now roams the streets of Drakkenheim as an eldritch energy infused corpse with a distinct, shiny metal arm. It uses the stat block for a **deathlock mastermind** but instead of feeling servitude to a patron, he is obsessed with his work. His feverish will to create new contraptions has overtaken the memories of his life as an Amethyst Academy member, so his efforts are slowed down by the limited tools and materials he has at hand.
He is accompanied by an **automaton** similar to the ones in the Cosmological Clocktower and by a retinue of **haze wights** that do his bidding. 
He could potentially be bargained with by someone who understands his desires and exploits his blind spots.

## The Silver Arm is the key
Beltrand’s magical arm is still working perfectly even after his un-death, and it is still wearing his sigil ring. Furthermore, the doors of the Academy will recognize the arm as Bertrand and open the door for him - with or without the rest of his remains attached to him.
This means that if the PCs obtain the Silver Arm, they have a way inside the Inscrutable Tower.
Alternatively, they could convince Beltrand to follow them to the Tower and open the doors for them with the promise to lead them to his old working grounds. They have to be careful though: if they reveal too much and Beltrand feels like he doesn’t need them, he’ll betray them and try to kill them (and strip them for parts).

## More than the front door
Beltrand’s arm can also open the door to his old living quarters. Inside, the PCs can find his notes, that can be used by an Artificer or someone else with arcane and engineering expertise to craft a Pressurized Suit - works as a Hazewalker Plate, with the following changes:
+ It has the statistics of a _leather armor +1_.
+ All the effects have to be activated by closing the appropriate valves, sealing various components, etc. The procedure takes 1 minute.
+ Once activated, it provides the benefit of a Hazewalker Plate up to 8 hours before needing a day to recharge.

Within his living quarters the PCs can also find a couple of his previous inventions:
+ An inch long **magi-mechanical scarab** that can be wound up with a metal key. If placed inside a keyhole, it will pick the lock as per the spell Knock. After one use it needs one day to recharge.
+ A small **segmented metal cube** with sliding parts. It functions as a Bag of Holding but can only be opened by resolving the puzzle (which requires an **Investigation DC 20** check the first time). Within the cube there are a bag of diamond dust (worth 500gp), several finely machined valves of various size, a collection of alchemical stoppered flasks, some intricate gold inlaid tubing and a bundle of enchanted leather - they can be used as components to craft a Pressurized Suit by someone with the schematics and access to a well-equipped arcane forge (such facilities can only be found within the Inscrutable Tower or other distant Amethyst Academy strongholds).

## Foreshadowing
If you are running this adventure, Beltrand’s story and description can be foreshadowed to the PCs. 
+ They could learn about the existence of a metal-armed creature roaming the streets of Drakkenheim from another adventuring party or a faction strike team.
+ They could also learn about this creature’s obsession for machinery - a lucky survivor who was able to escape the monster’s attention once it had become fixated with a gnomish mechanical toy the survivor was carrying.
+ A description of Bertrand’s looks and/or behavior may lead him to be easily identified by any member of the Amethyst Academy.
