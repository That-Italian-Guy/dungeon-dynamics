## What Lurks in the Waters
Located between the Sprawl and the Drann River, the Leopold Von Drakken Reservoir has survived the fall of Drakkenheim mostly intact. Protected by 20 feet of soil, the old underground arched stone vaults have not been breached by the falling meteor and fresh water for irrigation and animal husbandry is still collected in its vast pools.
This however, does not mean that the Reservoir is free of danger: a sentient **delerium weird** has made its lair in it, fed by its many **delerium weird spawns**. 
If the characters can safely navigate its waters, they may be able to find an additional way into the city proper, bypassing the gates.

## Delerium Weirds
The delerium weird and its spawns are absorbing the bodies of all the unfortunates that die above and inside the Reservoir; the weird is also feeding off of the Contamination of the Haze and the Delerium inside the Reservoir.

A **delerium weird** uses the stat block for an **adult oblex**. The weird absorbs the Haze within the Reservoir, but is constantly craving Delerium or other sources of Contamination on top of an oblex desire for intelligent minds. The weird is able to use its Eat Memories action on dead bodies as well as alive creatures. When used on a dead body, the body is consumed and absorbed by the weird. Its spawns drag the corpses of any unfortunate they can collect to the weird, for it to feed on them. 
These characteristics can be exploited to strike some kind of bargain with the weird:
+ It can provide the PCs with insights about the nature and uses of Delerium due to its peculiar diet.
+ It can also provide details about a few selected locations in Drakkenheim (at the DM’s choice); the weird has gained this knowledge by absorbing a relevant adventurer or city dweller. 
+ The weird can provide safe passage to the city by pointing out which tunnel the PCs can take to get into it.

A **delerium weird spawn** uses the stat block for **oblex spawn** with the following extra features:
+ **Absorb Contamination**: as an action, the spawn targets a creature it can touch. The creature has to succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or lose 1 level of Contamination and gain 2 levels of Exhaustion and become Poisoned for 2 (1d4) hours. The spawn can’t use this action again until it has used its Transfer Contamination action. 
+ **Transfer Contamination**: as an action, the spawn touches a willing delerium weird. The weird is immediately healed for 20 (3d10 + 3) HP; any excess heal is turned into temporary hit points instead. Can only be used after the spawn has successfully used Absorb Contamination.
+ **Feeding Frenzy**: when the spawn successfully uses Absorb Contamination it gains 10ft extra movement, and becomes Reckless. The effect lasts until it successfully uses Transfer Contamination.
+ **Imperfect receptacle**: if the spawn is unable to use Transfer Contamination within 1h after it has successfully used Absorb Contamination, it explodes in a shower of contaminated slime. It immediately goes to 0HP and all the creatures within 10ft have to succeed on a **DC 12 Constitution** saving throw or gain 1 level of Contamination and become Poisoned for 2 (1d4) hours.

## The Water Reservoir
Suggested map:

+ The water inside the Reservoir is not Contaminated. Creatures can safely wade in it without gaining Contamination levels.
+ There is no Haze effect within the Reservoir, although resting in it is made difficult by the abundance of **delerium weird spawns** and by the presence of the **delerium weird**.
+ The water is as safe to drink for a creature as unfiltered, unboiled fresh water from a lake would be.
+ Unless otherwise stated, the vaults are 15 ft. tall and the water is 3ft deep.

## Another way into town
The reservoir is connected to the inner city by a series of pipes and tunnels meant to bring irrigation waters to the gardens and parks of Drakkenheim. Most of these are too small to move through, but there is a large enough tunnel to allow passage for Small and Medium creatures.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/drakkenheim_extras/what_lurks2.webp" caption="Suggested Location for the Reservoir." %}

+ The tunnel is only large enough to allow Small creatures through without issues. Medium creatures have to proceed at half their regular speed.
+ The tunnel is connected to the Rose Theatre, to the Queen’s Park Garden and to any other unnamed privately owned park or garden the DM wants to.
+ This is a back-breaking exercise. PCs should take appropriate exhaustion checks at a regular intervals.

## Adventure Hooks
+ Delerium weird spawns can be seen from time to time above the surface of the Reservoir, collecting Delerium chips and the bodies of dead creatures to bring to the weird. A rumor about this can be easily spread to the PCs.
+ While the delerium weird doesn’t normally leave its lair, it does so from time to time when the pickings are slim. Remus Spiritgiver, a commoner who used to be a potter in Drakkenheim, has had a close encounter with it and survived to tell the tale.
  + He can tell the PCs how, while he was trying to recover some tools from his old shop outside town, he ran into Charlie, his apprentice.
  + Charlie was presumed dead in the fall of the city.
  + Since Charlie was acting weird and since he isn’t an idiot, Remus was on edge. He can tell the PCs how, as soon as Charlie had started moving towards him, he felt ill.
  + He ran without turning back.
  + He can reward the PCs to recover his tools (15gp).
+ A rival adventuring party or a merchant may be overheard complaining how the area around the old Reservoir has been completely stripped of Delerium once again, after they had spotted a promising formation.
