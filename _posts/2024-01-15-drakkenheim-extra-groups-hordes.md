These rules aim at infusing new life into the iconic inhabitants of Drakkenheim, ensuring they remain relevant to the game without bogging down gameplay. Drawing inspiration from the ingenious Squad design introduced in Level Up: Advanced 5th Edition (A5E), this is an alternative approach to MCDM/4e minion style creatures that adds the same dynamic layer, making encounters more engaging without overwhelming the Dungeon Master.

These stat blocks use the **bloodied**  and **weakened** custom condition. 

A creature is **bloodied** when it has lost at least half of its maximum hit points. This does not have any direct impact, but one or more effects may check for this condition.

The damage caused by a **weakened** creature's attacks is halved.

**Group.** The group is composed of several base creatures. If it is subjected to a spell, attack, or other effect that affects only one target, It takes the damage but ignores other effects. It can share its space with Medium or smaller creatures or objects. The group can move through any opening large enough for one Medium creature without squeezing.

**Area Vulnerability.** The group is vulnerable against damage from any effect that targets an area.

**Horde Dispersal.** When the group is bloodied, it becomes weakened. When the group is reduced to 0 hit points, it turns into 2 (1d4) base creatures that are bloodied.

**Death Burst (group).** If damage bloodies the group or it reduces the group to 0 hit points, the delerium fragments in its body explode in a burst of contaminated energy, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. Each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a **DC 12 Constitution** saving throw of take 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. Creatures who fail this saving throw by 5 or more gain one level of contamination.

**ACTIONS**

**Grab.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit 13 (3d6+3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 13).

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one grappled target. Hit: 16 (3d8+3) piercing damage, and the group regains the same number of hit points.
