These are some monsters that I have been using for my Dungeons of Drakkenheim campaign. Please be advised that these come with a general content warning for the themes commonly explored in dark fantasy, IE: body horror.

## Angler Flesh

This amorphous blob of flesh looks like several different creatures merged together. The **Angler Flesh** owes its name to the lure attached to its main body through a slender fleshy appendage. The creature is able to morph the end of this appendage into the body of any small, innocuous creature it has previously absorbed (IE: a cat or a dog); it uses this mimicry to attract its prey, then strikes unannounced. It has the statistics of a **gibbering mouther**, with this additional Feature:  
+ **Angler’s Lure**: if a creature moves within 10ft of the Angler’s lure it is targeted by the Angler’s Bites attack. The Angler has advantage on the attack unless the target succeeds on a  **DC 14 Perception** roll. The Angler moves within 5 ft of the target as part of its Bites attack.
+ The Angler’s Flesh’s **Gibbering** Action is not active while the creature is stalking its prey.

## Severed Hulk (Haze Hulk mutation)
This is a new **Haze Hulk** variant. It has the following features:
+ **Increased CR**: a severed hulk has a CR of 5.
+ **Severance**: the first time the severed hulk suffers a critical hit or becomes bloodied[^1], its head gets split from its body. The Head immediately grows spindly spidery legs and rolls for Initiative. The Head has the same stats as the Hulk, with the following changes: 35 HP and a single Bite attack (+7 to hit, reach 5ft, one target, 12 (2d6+5) slashing damage). The severed hulk becomes blinded.
+ **Regrowth**: as an action during its turn the Head can attach itself to a corpse or other source of dead flesh. At the start of its next turn, if the Head isn’t incapacitated it consumes the dead flesh and grows into a new severed hulk.

## Sludge Ooze
A blob of animated delerium sludge, not large enough to be an animated delerium sludge. It uses a **gray ooze** stat block with the following changes:
+ **Lowered stats**: a sludge ooze has CR ¼ and 12 HP. 
+ **Delerium creature**: the ooze loses its resistance to fire and gains resistance to necrotic damage.
+ **Non-corrosive**: the sludge loses its Corrosive Body and False Appearence features. Its pseudopod attack deals extra necrotic damage (that inflicts Minor Contamination[^2] if you are using this rule) and doesn’t corrode armor.
+  **Volatile**: the ooze is vulnerable to fire. If it’s reduced to 0HP by fire damage, it explodes causing 11 (3d6) necrotic damage to every creature within 10ft (save **DC 12 Constitution** halves). This damage inflicts Minor Contamination[^2] if you are using this rule)

## Sludge-blooded Hulk (Haze Hulk mutation)
This is a new **Haze Hulk** variant. It has the following features:
+ **Delerium Blood**: as a reaction when the Hulk is dealt physical damage, it bleeds out a sludge ooze that immediately rolls for initiative.
+ **Volatile**: the hulk is vulnerable to fire. If it’s reduced to 0HP by fire damage, it explodes causing 20 (3d10+3) necrotic damage to every creature within 20ft (save **DC 14 Constitution** halves). This damage inflicts Minor Contamination[^2] if you are using this rule).
+ **Spray Ooze**: as a bonus action, the Hulk can spray some ooze against an enemy withing 60ft. The target must succeed on a DC14 Constitution saving throw or suffer 7 (2d6) necrotic damage (that inflicts Minor Contamination[^2] if you are using this rule). Then, spawn a sludge ooze (that immediately rolls for initiative) in an empty space next to the target.

## Haze Brute
A humanoid made unreasonably large and angry by the perils of Contamination. Uses the stat block of an **ogre** with the following changes:
+ **Slam (replaces Greatclub)**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a **DC 13 Strength** saving throw or become prone.
+ **Sweeping Strike (replaces Javelin)**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., all creatures within 5 feet. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a **DC 13 Strength** saving throw or be pushed 10ft away from the brute.
+ **Grab & Throw (reaction)**: Whenever a creature within 5ft of it tries to stand from prone, the Brute can use its reaction to grab it and throw it up to 10ft away. The creature has to succeed on a **DC 13 Dexterity** saving throw or suffer 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage (save halves). If it is thrown against another Medium or larger creature or solid object, the save is made with disadvantage and the second creature must also make a **DC 13 Dexterity** save or become prone.

## The Wandering Titan
This is less of a creature and more of an area denial tool. I came up with it when I asked myself _why has no one so far explored the Chapel of St. Brenna and claimed the relic within if it’s outside the city walls and can be tackled by a lv3 party?_ My answer is the **Wandering Titan**.
+ The titan was once part of Drakkenheim’s automated defences, same as the Gargoyles and Tower Dragons, but instead of protecting the walls and castle, it was meant to assist with heavy construction/other hazardous activities and to protect the population outside of the city proper. The Haze has affected it and it is now malfunctioning. It doesn’t patrol an area the same way the other automated defences do, but it wanders the outskirts of Drakkenheim; its path is unpredictable, although it’s quite easy to hear and see it coming. 
+ The Titan is dangerous, as it perceives everyone that is not a dreg as an invader; but the Haze interferes with its inner workings, so it is easily distracted. In fact, it mostly lays still most of the time, springing back to “life” only if it perceives a danger in close proximity.
+ At the start of the adventure, the Titan has been parked in front of the Chapel of St. Brenna for the past few years…but it has recently started wandering again. The Titan uses the stat block of a [Level Up: A5E Stone Colossus](https://a5e.tools/node/1674).

[^1]: A creature is **bloodied** when it has lost at least half of its maximum hit points. This does not have any direct impact, but one or more effects may check for this condition.
