This post contains all the extra bits and bobs I used in my Dungeons of Drakkenheim campaing, including new rules to handle contamination, a different take on the Queen's Men and a bunch of random tables to spice up your game.

## Minor Contamination
Contamination is a massive issue for characters in Drakkenheim, and so it should be - it acts as a gatekeep so that they don’t go too far too soon, it forces them to seek the help of the various Factions or other NPCs, etc. 
That said, Contamination is very black&white in its mechanics - something may contaminate you faster but one level of Contamination is one level of Contamination no matter what; there isn’t a smaller amount of Contamination you can gain. Because of that, Contamination levels add up quickly or they don’t increase at all; and if they increase they are difficult to remove, especially at low levels.
**Minor Contamination** is an optional rule that introduces lower grade sources of Contamination. You may want to use this to ease your party into the whole idea of Contamination:
+ Contaminating Attacks or effects from from low CR enemies (like a haze husk’s Death Burst, up to even a haze wight’s Contaminated Touch) lose the “gain 1 level of contamination” effect. Instead, the necrotic damage inflicted by such attacks and effects creates a build-up of eldritch energies in the body of the affected creature. 
+ Keep track of the amount of necrotic damage inflicted by contaminated sources this way. Whenever the counter becomes higher than the character’s HP total, they immediately gain 1 level of Contamination and the counter goes back to 0.
+ Sources that don’t inflict necrotic damage but aren’t contaminated enough to immediately cause 1 level of Contamination raise this counter instead. IE: when characters wade in lightly contaminated rainwater, they may gain X points on the counter.
+ You may consider having city outskirts areas be less affected by the Haze; in this case, spending more than 24h in such areas may significantly increase the counter instead of causing the character to immediately gain 1 level of Contamination if they fail their save.
+ The same way, you may consider low level contaminated spells, like Delerium Orb or Warp Bolt, to increase this counter (IE: by the amount of damage they cause) instead of causing the Contamination level to straight up increase by 1.
+ The contamination counter goes to 0 whenever the characters finish a Long Rest outside of a contaminated area.

## Delerium Cyphers
Delerium is a source of wealth for the PCs and can already be used as an arcane source but I feel like, in itself, gaining delerium doesn’t have a high enough woah coefficient to work as one of the main reasons to explore Drakkenheim. Delerium Cyphers are meant to act as an additional lure for the PCs to seek Delerium out. Inspired by the Cypher item system in [Numenera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numenera) and the Altered Items from [Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_(video_game)).

### Cypher characteristics
+ Delerium Cyphers are unique formations of Delerium infused with unpredictable eldritch energies. They crystallize around (often mundane) items like a boot, a candle, a length of rope, etc and become one with them.
+ Cyphers are suffused with a dim but visible octarine light. Sometimes they exhibit uncommon physical properties (like a bendy piece of metal or a transparent glove).
+ Cyphers can be shattered to release the eldritch energies contained within. This destroys the cypher and leaves behind 5 (2d4) delerium chips. 
+ Academics are unsure about the origin of Delerium Cyphers. They can appear in an apparent random pattern within Drakkenheim, although they are more frequent in areas covered in Deep Haze.
+ If you use the [Haze Moon event](https://that-italian-guy.github.io/dungeon-dynamics/drakkenheim%20extras/drakkenheim-extra-haze-moon/), Cyphers are more common for its duration.
+ They are highly coveted by arcanists, adventurers and merchants.
+ Most factions are obviously interested in the magical powers the Cyphers can release; the Academy and Followers of the Falling Fire are interested in learning more from them. The Queen’s Men are attracted to the profit they represent and the Silver Order want to destroy these vile trinkets.

### Cypher effects
Mechanically speaking, Delerium Cyphers are one time use magic items. 
+ They allow whoever shatter them to create a magical effect that mimics a specific spell (or the effects can be custom tailored by the GM).
+ Cyphers allow the PCs to have a one time access to a powerful magical effect. Consider granting access to spells that are 1 or even 2 levels above what your PCs can normally cast (so a party that has access to 2nd level spells could find a Cypher that allows them to 1 time cast a 4th level spell).
+ _Identify_ is needed to figure out what a Cypher can do. Or it can be shattered hoping for the best…
+ Each Cypher is activated by shattering the crystals on it in the way that makes more sense: a Fireball Cypher can be thrown towards the enemies, while an Animate Object one can be smashed against the item that has to be animated and so on.

### Cypher examples
Some premade Cyphers:
1. A crystal encrusted, leathery bill of sale for a flock of sheep that casts Locate Creature.
2. A large and flat gold coin that casts Arcane Lock.
3. An icy and bent dowsing rod that casts Speak with Dead.
4. An antique pipe that casts Wall of Fire.
5. A muddy, smooth red feather that casts Haste.
6. A sticky, broken music box that casts Fear.
7. A glass jar with a pickled egg in it that casts Insect Plague.
8. A fuzzy bag filled with pebbles that casts Heat Metal.
9. An iridescent, glossy toy soldier that casts Arcane Hand.
10. A wet rabbit foot amulet that casts Conjure Animals.

### Cypher random table
You can use this table to randomly determine the look of a Cypher.

## Variant: Firebrand Queen’s Men
This variant can be used to make the Queen's Men be more enticing as an allied faction for your PCs. Instead of being generic thugs, they are a group of firebrand revolutionaries that see the fall of Drakkenheim and the subsequent civil unrest as an opportunity to overthrow the established order.  They are a loose amalgamation of outcasts, peasants, artisans, merchants, political undesirables, etc. Their endgame is for their leader to take the Crown and change things for the betterment of the "common man".
The way this "betterment" is achieved and who this "common man" is are probably quite different depending on who you ask to - from total utopic anarchy, to a mercantile republic, to an elective monarchy, etc. What they all share though, is that they are done with the hereditary monarchy and the rule of the nobles.

They would still be criminals in the eyes of the world at large - and some of them are going to be just that: ruffians and cutthroats, in it for the short term gain to be had in taking "what's theirs" from the ruling class of Westemär. Others though would be true believers: the moniker "Queen of Thieves" would become an ironic one, a name given to her by her enemies and reclaimed by her followers.
Everyone believes that the Queen's first act as...Queen, would be to dissolve the monarchy as it is right now and to give the power to [the common man]. Of course, the ultimate question would be...is the Queen really going to do that, if she gets what she wants?

These changes would give the Queen's Men a few more openings towards other factions:
+ They would share a short term goal of "restore Drakkenheim to an inhabitable state" with the Hooded Lanterns, and maybe even elicit sympathies from some of their less-than-noble members. Of course, the "down with the nobility" part of their plan is going to be untenable with the noblemen supporting the Lanterns, but who knows what can happen with a change of leadership? And they may even support the Queen's claim if she is to reveal her true identity.
+ On the opposite side of the spectrum, they would also have an unlikely short term ally in the Silver Order - the Elyrians would see the chaos sown by the Queen's Men as the perfect opportunity to seize a weakened Westemär without a "true" central leader.
+ In a similar fashion, the Amethyst Academy could see an opening in a Westemär without nobility; after all, they already have to give up their titles. Sure, they rule from the shadows as counselors right now...but in a world without order, it would be easy to manipulate the splintered emerging powers and no one could stop any of their endeavors.

## Random Tables

### Random Table: Spooky Events
The DoD book already has some awesome random tables for Common Locations and Warped Ruin. This table is meant to be a replacement for the “Nothing” result on the random encounter table. You can use of these results to spice things up a bit instead of having simply nothing happen and to add some extra mystique to the streets of Drakkenheim. Alternatively, you can decide to have an actual encounter whenever the players investigate the event.

| Spooky Events (roll 1d20) | Spooky Events (roll 1d20) |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1. A whimpering noise can be heard coming from a nearby basement. | 11. Strange symbols have been carved atop the doorway that leads into a decrepit mansion. |
| 2. A glowing figure can be seen for a moment at a window in a nearby building. | 12. An unknown, spongy fungus is growing all over the wooden surfaces of a nearby abandoned house. |
| 3. The PCs' shadows stretch unnaturally across the street. | 13. The body of a dreg is fused with the wall of a nearby building as if it was teleported inside it. |
| 4. Gravel, small bones and other junk are floating mid-air. | 14. Something is scraping against the closed door of a nearby building. |
| 5. A foreboding presence can be felt for a moment on the back of one of the PCs’ head. | 15. Octarine moats of light are dancing across the street in a recurring pattern. |
| 6. A figure resembling a woman with long claws can be seen between the rubble. It is actually some kind of twig and cloth human-sized puppet. | 16. A random mundane item appears out of thin air next to the PCs with an audible “pop”. |
| 7. The body of a man is half stuck in a sewer drain, as if it was dragged into it from below. | 17. A rag ball falls from the upper floor of a nearby ruined mansion. |
| 8. A door suddenly slams open/shut as the PCs pass by. | 18. Puddles of foul-smelling, seemingly boiling liquid are bubbling up from the pavement. |
| 9. A weird shimmering distortion is affecting the pavement of the street in front of the PCs. | 19. One of the PCs experiences an intense sense of deja-vu. |
| 10. A decapitated body lies in the middle of the street. | 20. One of the PCs feels being observed. |

### Random Table: Dead body
The PCs will often run into the remains of an unfortunate soul - or even a monster - that has encountered their final fate in Drakkenheim. The PCs may have to roll an appropriate DC Medicine check to figure out some of these.
