# Introduction 
In the vast tapestry of tabletop role-playing, the monsters that inhabit your dungeons and darkened lairs are more than mere stat blocks—they are the architects of excitement, the conduits of challenge, and the beating hearts of every memorable encounter. 

I’m That Italian Guy, a Dungeon Master with over two decades of experience and a TTRPG game designer.

Join me as we uncover the secrets to building action-oriented monsters - creatures that forego the traditional 'hit and be hit' formula to seize the spotlight with tactics, synergies, and surprises.

## Article structure and chapters
The article is split up into chapters, so feel free to skip ahead if you are already familiar with certain concepts! 
- In the first part, we're having an overview of Action-Oriented Design and checking out two Skeletons—one more conventional, and the other with an Action-Oriented vibe.
- Next up, we're going to review and discuss the Pillars of 5e monster design. We're talking offense, defense, and keeping the action economy solid but not overwhelming.
- In the last two parts, we're going to build a Boss monster and its minions, according to the principles discussed in the previous parts.
- Jump to the end to grab a free one-shot adventure featuring the monsters we're designing, a free battlemap, and VTT resources for online play!

## What is Action-Oriented Design
In simple terms, Action-Oriented Design means we're creating monsters that can do more—both in terms of quantity and quality. Their stat blocks get a boost in the action department, giving them something to do with their bonus actions and reactions. This broader range of options allows the designer to create synergies and incorporate tactical elements right there in the monster's stat block.

But is that all? Well, kinda. With a variety of actions, these monsters pack more personality—they express who they are through this improved action economy. It also adds a layer of back-and-forth for players—can they counter the monster's tactics? And let's not forget, it gives Dungeon Masters more cool stuff to play around with—DMs are players too, after all!

# Part 1: Conventional vs Action-Oriented Design comparison
Now, let's see how this plays out when facing a similar creature: one designed conventionally and another embracing Action-Oriented Design.

The Dungeon Master sets the scene—a party weaving through desolated ruins, torchlight flickering in a chilling wind, when suddenly, skeletal remains of long-gone adventurers rise to attack!

A classic scenario - a low level party against a group of Skeletons. 

Meet the Conventional 5e Skeleton. It can do two things: attack with a shortsword; or attack with a shortbow. Both are +4 to hit and they both deal 1d6+2 points of piercing damage. The Dungeon Master gives us the lowdown, describing its appearance and highlighting its vulnerabilities and immunities. Yet, beyond its looks and resistances, its identity feels somewhat generic. We could be facing a brittle boned goblin that has been dosing with cobra poison their whole life and the stat block would be mostly identical.

Now, let's shift to an Action-Oriented monster—the Four-Armed Skeleton from Level Up Advanced 5e Monstrous Menagerie. At first glance, it seems similar, even sharing identical attack actions. But a deeper dive reveals its uniqueness.

This stat block tells us we're dealing with a monster that refuses to stay down—understandable since it lost all its meat and is still kicking! With Elite Recovery, it automatically shakes off a Condition each turn when below half its maximum hit points. It boasts more hit points than a regular ¼ CR monster (double the amount of the conventional skeleton, in fact), maintaining vulnerability to bludgeoning damage but “simulating” a resistance to other damage types due to increased HP. The crucial difference? It's a resistance that doesn't frustrate players; no one wants to roll and be told they inflict a measly 2 points of damage. The Conventional skeleton's low hit points ensure it will encounter a swift demise no matter the weapon, making its resistance irrelevant. But you'll definitely see a fighter switch to their mace when facing this one!

Incidentally, the majority of Action-Oriented monsters were crafted during the later stages of the 5e development cycle, leading to this kind of “player-friendly” and more elegant approach to design.

Back to our stat block! The more inquisitive of you may have noticed that the Four-Armed Skeleton has, in fact, four arms. Unsurprisingly, the stat block reflects this by giving this monster an extra attack as a bonus action, whether with sword or bow. It also allows the Skeleton to take multiple reactions due to its Reactive Arms trait, further underlining the relentless nature of this monster.

Now, some may remark, "But TIG, this seems like a minor addition." Indeed, the stat block itself is fairly simple. However, the first time the party wizard attempts to move away from a Four-Armed Skeleton confident that the Barbarian has already “used” its reaction, a subtle yet crucial shift occurs. Something unexpected, yet entirely foreseeable in hindsight—something that makes players go "oh!" with either a grin or a grimace.Something imprinting the encounter and the monster into the players' collective memory.  Next time they face a Four-Armed Skeleton, they’ll remember.

There's another subtle element in this creature's design. It's not merely about having 3 attacks instead of 2—the additional one is a bonus action. Why is this important? A bonus action represents a discrete quantity of a monster's action economy and acts as a balancing factor in its design. Consider this: the Four-Armed Skeleton is fighting alongside a Necromancer capable of bestowing them a defensive feature requiring a bonus action to be used. Now, choices need to be made—utilize the extra attack or opt for the added magical defenses. Or let’s say that someone casts Slow on the Skeleton - if they just had 3 attacks on their stat block, they would still be able to make all of them.

# Part 2: Pillars of Effective Monster Design
So, is the solution simply to layer more actions and reactions onto existing monsters to transform them into Action-Oriented creatures? It's a bit more nuanced than that. We still need to stick to the fundamental Pillars of balance.

So, let's dive into some aspects that, while not exclusive to Action-Oriented Design, are nonetheless crucial components of crafting a 5e monster and play a vital role in the overall design process.

Based on its Challenge Rating, a monster should present a certain level of offense to challenge the players; it should have adequate defenses to thwart their attacks; and its action economy should be robust, without slowing down the game to a crawl or overwhelming the players.

## Determine the Challenge Rating
Before you do anything else, you should start by picking a Challenge Rating for your monster. This decision essentially establishes the monster's power level relative to the players. All the subsequent elements we'll design revolve around this decision. 

For now, we are going to stick to a generic rule of thumb:at Tier 1, especially before level 3, players are pretty squishy. But at level 5, things get spicy as they usually get a second attack or level 3 spells. After that, it's a steady power climb. The amount of PCs is a party is obviously an important part of the equation; it is customary to balance creatures around the average party size of either four or five player characters. In this series, we are assuming a party of 5 as our baseline.
.
By following this (extremely simplified) approach, and assuming a single monster vs the party, we can say that:
Level 1 characters will mostly face enemies up to CR 1.
PCs above level 1 but below 5 should tackle enemies not higher than their level +2.
Tier 2 characters can handle enemies up to their level +5.
Tier 3 and 4 PCs can take on monsters up to their level +7 and even more.
If you're designing a monster for a specific campaign, knowing when the party will face this creature is key. Of course, the numbers change if you've got more monsters in an encounter (we'll get into that later).

And if you're just crafting an enemy without a specific party or campaign in mind, you can still use this simple guide to guess the average power level for a creature of a specific CR. 

Balancing encounters is a whole other beast and deserves its own chat in another video. And if you want a more in depth discussion on this topic, you can’t really go wrong with The Lazy DM’s Forge of Foes (this is, in fact, an excellent resource for building action oriented monsters in general!).

 But for today, the big takeaway is this: pick a CR before you start your monster design journey.

### Monster Building exercise - CR
Now, let's roll up our sleeves and craft an example to illustrate this concept. Our party? A seasoned team of five level-five adventurers. To face them, we’re going to build a boss monster with a trio of sidekicks.Since this is a boss fight, we want it to be quite challenging - so the Boss is going to be a CR 7 monster and its underlings are going to be CR 2. 

We are also going to pick an identity for our adversaries. Crafting a memorable theme is crucial in monster design, and it holds even more significance when developing an Action-Oriented creature - The identity should emerge through its name, its art and the actions in the stat block, shaping a memorable and engaging villain. Keep an eye out for a future video dedicated solely to this (quite expansive) topic!

We’ll dub our Boss monster the “Void Invader”. It is going to be an otherworldly creature, with the power to rupture reality and draw in Void Spawns from the space between worlds - its underlings in this fight. This is going to be a Deadly encounter for a five player party of level five adventurers.

## Expected Values based on CR
I emphasized the CR selection because in 5e, there's a structured reliance on an expected average value for a creature's stats, all determined by its Challenge Rating.

A good example of this is something in 5e called “bounded accuracy”. It's basically the game's way of keeping things in check and avoiding crazy power creep. Unlike earlier editions, where numbers would skyrocket with each level, 5e maintains a more restrained scaling system. Whether it's the chance to hit or the DC of a creature’s effects, the increments are more moderate and, more important for our design needs, more linear.

This implies that nearly every aspect of a monster’s design has a measurable, expected average value linked to its Challenge Rating. A couple of excellent resources for this kind of math are BLOGOFHOLDING.COM's Monster Manual on a Business Card and Level Up: Advanced 5e's DESIGNING MONSTERS section of the Monster Menagerie. Both are fairly similar - which is unsurprising since they were both based on existing 5e official monsters and, as far as I know, both were written by Paul Hughes. Forge of Foes also provides its tables and rules for expected monster stats based on CR. 

## Expected Offensive Capabilities
Once you have established the CR of your monster, the first step is figuring out how good it should be at landing attacks and how tough its abilities are to resist. This boils down to two key factors: the monster’s proficiency bonus and how high their main attack Ability (like Dexterity or Charisma) is.

As a rule of thumb, a CR1 creature typically has a +4 to hit with attacks (a +2 proficiency bonus and +2 from their main attack Ability). The DC of their effects with a save average around 12 (8 base +2 proficiency bonus and +2 from their main attack Ability). These numbers increase somewhat linearly, with a bump every two CRs or so.

Now, let's talk about damage. A quick rule of thumb is to start at 10 damage per round for a CR1 creature and increase by 5 damage per round for each CR increment.

Keep in mind, these are average values, and monsters may deviate based on their role, fantasy, and design. This is where the beauty of Action-Oriented design shines—two creatures might have a similar attack ratio and damage pattern, but their approach could be wildly different, injecting variety into combat - a crucial aspect in a game like Dungeons and Dragons that heavily relies on this type of encounter.

### Monster Building exercise - Offense
We're sticking close to the averages to showcase how you can craft unique monsters from similar building blocks.Our Void Invader is a CR 7 creature, so we know it is going to have:
- A +3 proficiency bonus and a “good” ability score with a +4 modifier.
- Its attacks are going to have a +7 to hit and the DC for his effects is going to be 15.
- It is going to have an average damage per round of 40.
The Void Spawns are CR 2 monsters, so their offenses are going to be as follows:
- +2 proficiency bonus and +3 ability modifier.
- +5 to hit, DC 13.
- 15 damage per round on average.

## Expected Defensive Capabilities
Based on a Monster’s CR we can also extrapolate their average Hit Points and how high their Armor Class and “Good” Saves are going to be. 

As a general rule of thumb, a CR 1 monster will have around 30 hit points and this number climbs by roughly 15 for each CR above one.. 

When it comes to their "Good" saves—the ones benefiting from both their “Good” Ability score and proficiency bonus—you can expect them to match their attack bonus or fall slightly below. So if a creature boasts a +7 to hit, their good saves will likely be either +7 or +6.

Now, let's tackle Armor Class. The general rule is to begin at AC 13 or 14 for a CR 1 to 3 creature, adding +1 every three CRs. Among the "expected" values we've explored, Armor Class tends to exhibit more significant deviations based on a monster's design and fantasy. For example, a CR ⅛ Guard may sport 16 AC, while a CR 8 T-Rex might surprisingly have a modest AC 13.The important thing to remember is that bounded accuracy is a thing in 5e and that missing most of your attacks is not fun - it’s usually better to give monsters increased health or more interesting defensive abilities instead of just bumping their AC sky-high.

### Monster Building exercise - Defense
We are also going to stick to average values more or less when it comes to our villains’ defenses. The Void Invader will have:
- Around 120 hit points.
- Good saves in the +6 to +7 range.
- An AC of 15.
The Void Spawns, at CR 2, will have values similar to these:
- 45 hit points.
- Good saves around +4 to +5.
- AC 13.

## Action Economy Balance
Action economy boils down to the number of actions a side can take in a round - it is like the currency of combat in 5e and, as such, it is a critical component of monster and encounter balance. You can picture it as a resource that defines the number of moves each side can make in a round. The more moves your party has, the better their chances, and conversely, the more moves the monsters have, the tougher the encounter becomes.

Now, conventional monsters often lag in the action economy game, sticking to a simple routine—one action per turn, usually one or more identical attacks or a flashy ability. But in the late stage of 5e development, where player classes offer a smorgasbord of choices for actions, bonus actions, and reactions, players facing similar numbers of monsters gain a mechanical edge.

To address this action imbalance in conventional design, the usual tricks involve making monsters "mathematically" superior to PCs (dealing more damage or being tougher to hit) or tossing more monsters into the mix. Both have their pitfalls, though. 
A high-damage monster could - given bounded accuracy and the innate low-high swing of a dice based damage system - swiftly take out a single PC, leading to less fun for the affected player.  Conversely, adding more combatants can turn the fight into an admin nightmare, with loads of individual attack rolls and hit point tracking.

By applying elements of Action-Oriented design to our monsters, we can somewhat balance the action economy of combat, while making things more interesting for our players. However, we must tread carefully and consider "how many things" our monsters can do in a turn, especially when designing monsters that act in groups. This helps avoid overwhelming the players with the monsters' improved action economy and prevents the combat from dragging on excessively.

Compared to other Pillars of Effective Game Design, action economy has more nuance, making it challenging to abstract as a simple numerical value. A good rule of thumb is that, when facing low-level adventurers, monsters should be able to reliably do only a couple of things each turn. Then, their action economy should improve around level 5 and every 5-6 levels after that - more or less each time the PCs’ action economy improves. This doesn’t mean their stat block shouldn’t have more things—just that some of them should be situational. For example, the Four-Armed Skeleton only gets its Recovery trait when below half maximum hit points, and its reactions are limited by the fact that the PCs may not trigger a single one of those. 

The other thing to remember is that boss monsters - or any monster that is supposed to be a challenge for a full-fledged 5-member party - are affected by the action economy imbalance the most. This is where legendary or lair actions come in: by giving a Solo monster a chance to act outside of their turn, we level the playing field a bit.

### Monster Building exercise - Action Economy
We want our Big Bad Evil Guy, the Void Invader, to be the main event in this showdown, so we're tailoring its action economy accordingly. It'll boast a couple of main actions, a bonus action, and a reaction. Given that it's bringing some friends into the mix, we're skipping Legendary Actions and opting for Lair Actions instead. Lair Actions are a solid choice when the odds are nearly even, maintaining that back-and-forth rhythm between the party and the monsters. Legendary Actions shine when the party faces a lone villain, but keep in mind that high-level bosses might need to have both to stand a chance against stronger characters!

We are going to further refine this next, when we start writing down the full stat blocks for our enemies.

# Part 3: Let’s Build a Boss monster
What do we know about the Void Invader? It is otherworldly, it punches holes in reality, it has creepy tendrils and a big maw at the center of its chest. How does his otherworldliness manifest? 

## Void Invader 
*Large aberration, chaotic evil*

**Armor Class** : 15 (natural armor) <br>
**Hit Points**  : 126 (12d10 + 60) <br>
**Speed**       : 40ft. <br>
___

**Challenge**            : 7 (2,900 XP) <br>
___
***Reality Shift (3/day).*** If the Invader fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead; when it does so, it loses any temporary hit points it currently has and it can’t use its *Chest Maw* attack until the end of its next turn.

***Reality Riptide.*** The Invader projects a strong un-reality field and its mere presence can torn asunder the fabric of reality when it senses its prey. When it rolls for initiative, the Invader opens breaches into the Void at three empty spots that it can see within 60 feet, shattering reality in a 10-feet-radius area centered around each spot. A creature starting their turn in one or more of these areas must succeed on a *DC 15 Wisdom* saving throw or be *restrained* until the start of their next turn. A creature restrained in such a way can use a bonus action to push their mind to its limits, removing the restrained condition and taking *14 (4d6)* psychic damage. The breaches persist for 1 hour or until the Invader rolls for initiative again.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The Invader makes two *Razor Grip* attacks. It can replace one of these with its *Synaptic Tendrils* action if available.

***Razor Grip.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to Hit, reach 10 ft, one target, Hit: *11 (2d6+4)* slashing damage and if the target is a Large or smaller creature it is *grappled* (escape DC 15) 

***Synaptic Tendrils (Recharge 5-6).*** The Invader probes the mind of each creature of its choice that it can see and that is within an area affected by *Reality Riptide*. Each of these creatures must make a *DC 15 Intelligence* saving throw or be *stunned* until the end of their next turn. A creature that fails the save can instead choose to take *22 (5d8)* psychic damage and immediately remove the stunned condition.

### Bonus Actions
***Chest Maw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to Hit, reach 5 ft, one creature, Hit: *13 (2d8+4)* piercing damage and the Invader gains as many temporary hit points. Can only be used against a creature the Invader is grappling or against a creature within an area affected by *Reality Riptide*.

### Rections
***Void Jaunt.*** When the Invader is damaged by an attack or spell, it can use its reaction to teleport to an empty spot that it can see within any area affected by *Reality Riptide*. Any creature grappled by the Invader is teleported with it, if it chooses so.

### Lair Actions
The Void Invader can only take these actions when it is in an area where the space between worlds is thin. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Void Invader can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Invade can't use the same lair action two rounds in a row:

***Spatial Anomaly.*** A creature the Invader can see within 120 ft. must make a *DC 15 Intelligence* saving throw or take *7 (2d6)* psychic damage and be teleported up to 30 ft to an empty spot on the ground of the Invader’s choice that it can see. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and is not teleported.

***Veil Breaker.*** Until the next initiative count 20, the area of shattered reality around a *Reality Riptide* breach is increased by 10 ft. to a 20-feet-radius area centered around each spot. During this time, a creature standing inside two or more of these areas at the same time makes the Wisdom saving throw against the effects of Reality Riptide with disadvantage.

***Dimensional Maw.*** The Invader makes a *Chest Maw* attack against up to two creatures. If a creature is within an area affected by *Reality Riptide*, the Invader can make the attack as if it was within reach as long as it can see the creature.

## Core Stats: Beyond the Tentacles

While these might be the driest aspects of a design task, Core Stats play a crucial role in informing both the GM and players about how a monster fundamentally interacts with the game world. Can it see in the dark? Can it communicate with the players? Is it agile or cumbersome? What kind of environment suits it best?

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/video-blogs/mm_vlog_001/invader_stats_001.jpg" caption="Void Invader Core stats." %}

Carefully crafting a monster's core stats allows us to signal its strengths and weaknesses. By aligning these stats with the fundamental aspects of the monster's design, we can infuse more flavor into it.

From a mechanical standpoint, unless dealing with a specialized creature, having a well-rounded core block is usually a good idea. This can be achieved by balancing strong and weak points or by creating an all-around balanced stat block.

Looking at our Invader, the concept art suggests it is powerfully built, and we can assume its otherworldly nature grants it superhuman resilience. However, its alien frame is poorly adapted to our world—its movements are erratic and jarring, as if in a constant struggle to maintain its form stable in this reality. Its mind proves to be as formidable a weapon as its claws and teeth, perhaps even more so.

## Acting out of initiative.
We want our Boss monster to be a visible presence throughout the fight, and this means having it act outside of its normal turn.

Occasionally, a monster centers around a crucial feature that shapes the entire encounter, setting up a scenario with a buildup and a payoff. However, the 5e initiative system poses a challenge: a Boss might roll poorly, delaying its actions significantly in the first turn. One potential solution, currently under exploration in One DnD, involves an ability that activates when a creature rolls for initiative.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/video-blogs/mm_vlog_001/invader_stats_002.jpg" caption="Reality Riptide allows the Invader to act at the start of the encounter." %}

Our Invader's first Trait plays a central role in shaping its entire stat block—many of its abilities center around the breaches it creates and their reality-bending effects.  We want our Invader to reliably deploy these at the start of a fight, but since Dexterity is its weak spot, the Invader is going to act at or below initiative 10 more often than not. By triggering this action when it rolls for initiative, we ensure that the Boss gets to do something flashy at the start of the combat, providing a more dynamic and engaging opening to the encounter while giving the players a chance to react before the Boss takes its turn. 
There is an interesting element to the saving throw, but we’ll talk more about this a bit later.

Another way to have the Boss feel more dramatic and impactful is to give it Lair Actions.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/video-blogs/mm_vlog_001/invader_stats_003.jpg" caption="Lair Actions improve the Invader's presence on the battlefield." %}

We aim for these actions to pack a punch equivalent to a full monster action, defining our Boss with flashy and memorable abilities. They should also be flexible enough that a monster will be able to reliably use all of them in a single fight.

Now, the catch with Lair Actions is their dependence on the monster being in some form of Lair. While this can be somewhat abstracted (as per our example), it poses limitations, preventing the monster from reaching its full potential outside the Lair's conditions. On the flip side, it opens a window for a clever party to disrupt the monster's effectiveness by luring it out of its Lair.

A noteworthy alternative, inspired by MCDM, is the concept of "Villain" actions. These operate similarly to Lair actions, but a powerful Boss monster inherently possesses them as part of its action-oriented design. You can learn more about this by checking out this video by Matt Colville, or their excellent Flee Mortals and Where Evil Lives 5e supplements.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/video-blogs/mm_vlog_001/flee_mortals.jpg" caption="MCDM's awesome monster manual." %}

**Spatial Anomaly**: The first Lair Action on the Invader’s stat block is a combination of utility and offense. Intelligence tends to be a disregarded save, as mind-affecting abilities typically target Wisdom or Charisma. Our goal is to make this otherworldly entity feel truly "out of this world" - this is not your average magic user, but an inscrutable, vast, cold, alien mind. From a mechanical standpoint, this action allows the Invader to strategically relocate a pesky Sentinel fighter near a breach in reality, or to lure a tasty snack from the backlines next to itself.

**Veil Breaker**: The second of the Invader’s Lair Actions allows it to play a nasty trick against those PCs that are standing dangerously close to the breaches, thinking they are safe. Tactical positioning is often an overlooked element in 5e and but it is quite relevant to this encounter. The surprise element adds a feeling of suspense—Will the breaches grow more? Will they move? It keeps players guessing and amps up the tension.

As for the third Lair Action, we'll hold off on discussing it for now, but we'll circle back to it shortly for reasons that will become apparent.

## Monster Bread and Butter: Actions
This part of a monster's stat block details its primary attacks, typically consuming a significant portion of a monster's damage budget, especially in the case of non-boss monsters. 

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/video-blogs/mm_vlog_001/invader_stats_004.jpg" caption="Actions represent a good chunk of a moster's potential." %}

**Multiattack**: This is going to be an omnipresent action in most monster stat blocks, with higher-level monsters featuring three or even four attacks as part of their Multiattacks. We want our monster’s offense to be split up into several discrete chunks, because of two reasons: we can use it to split damage over multiple targets, avoiding a player being pasted by a single 40 damage attack; and it allows the GM more flexibility, when several options are provided. In this case, the profile is simple enough and the monster is going to use two Razor Grip attacks whenever Synaptic Tendrils is not charged.

**Razor Grip**: Looking at the concept art, we see that our Invader has multiple spiked and clawed limbs. we'll provide it with two straightforward attacks that also carry the added effect of grappling the target upon a successful hit. This will allow the Invader to exert some level of control on the players’ positioning, granting it the ability to drag one or more grappled players into an area affected by a reality-shattering breach. We will allocate roughly half of the Invader’s damage budget to these attacks.

**Synaptic Tendrils**: It is customary for a Boss monster to have at least one scary area of effect attack with some kind of limited usage - a sorcerous fireball, a dragon’s breath attack and so on. These abilities allow the monster to flex its muscles in a flashy way; when these abilities come with a recharge roll, the players should be engaged in the result! In our case, our Invader has some mind tendrils to go with the physical ones crawling out of its face. It is also a save or suck effect…or is it?
